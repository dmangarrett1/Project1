Dungeon Crawler Game Playtest

This code I wrote for my Game Design course at Jacksonville State University. The code is for a test room for a video game I was making as a project in the class.

I have multiple sprites assigned to different sets of logic in the game and the room is used to test how they interact with each other. For instance, the player controlls a character who can fire a laser at enemies. The codde is set up to fire the laser when the spacebar is pushed and when the laser connects with an enemy the enemy takes damage or is destroyed. I have included a screenshot of this room in the repository.
